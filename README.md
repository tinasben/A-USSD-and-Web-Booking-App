The system is developed using node JavaScript and Mongo db. I have used AFRICASTALKING.COM API that enables communication via GSM network to ISPS like Safaricom and Airtel.

Ngrok is therefore used to create a secure URL to the local host server to the internet to enable communication via Africaâ€™s talking. The URL is only valid for 8 hours.
